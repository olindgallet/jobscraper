1.  Clone the repository.  Download the files.  However you choose, get the files on your system.
2.  Make sure you have Python3 installed.  If you want to use a virtual environment, go ahead.  ```pip3 install requirements.txt``` will get the required libraries.
3.  Set up a Google sheet for use.  Go to here for the information: https://ezsheets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.  This step will get you the unique authentication to set up your own sheet.
4. (optional)  Change the search queries based on your job.  
5.  Go to ```main.py``` and change your sheet id to the one you set up.  
6.  From the base folder run ```python3 main.py``` and check your Google sheet once the command prompt reappears.
